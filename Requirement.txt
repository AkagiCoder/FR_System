Running the Main Program
Before running the program, make sure to install python3 packages listed in the installation
guide section. To run main.py, you must run it as a super user (sudo) or else serial port
permission errors will appear:

"sudo python3 main.py"

Before installing the packages, make sure to install virtualenv (pip3 install virtualenv).
Creating an environment is done by:

"python3 -m venv nameOfTheEnv"

main.py Package Installation Guide
1) pip3 install RPi.GPIO
2) pip3 install pyserial [Don't forget to activate the serial port by menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Interfaces]
3) pip3 install pycamera
